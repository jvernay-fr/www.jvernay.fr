    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        I am Julien Vernay, a French student in IT, and I search an internship for the end of my studies, starting in January 2022.
        My passion for video games was the reason to start in this domain.
        Now, it is my curiosity for new technologies which has become my main driving force.
    </p><p>
        I have learnt during my course, and improved by myself, software development in C++ and Java, and embedded systems in C.
        I also build a large IT culture as my professional and personal experiences go by:
        network programming, Web standards, image processing, data processing, system administration with GNU/Linux.
    </p><p>
        My voluntary life shows my team spirit and the wish to broaden out, by organizing events for the student council,
        and by putting my skills to serve the school's robotic association.
    </p><p>
        You can find my resume <a href="/en/resume.html">here</a>.

    <h2>About this website</h2>
    <p>
        I created this website to present myself, but also to self-learn server management and Web technologies in general.
        Indeed, I use a VPS, to experiment different Internet technologies.
