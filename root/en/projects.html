    <summary>Crowd Control<span class="tags">[Game Jam] [Godot Engine]</span></summary>
    <p>
        In July 2020, I took part with two friends at the GMTK Game Jam, whose theme was <strong>Out of Control</strong>.
        Our game entry is <strong>Crowd Control</strong>, playable in the browser at <a href="https://nitsugua.itch.io/crowd-control">itch.io</a>.
        In this game, you must control the crowd so that it goes to the designated area.
        To do so, you use your mouse, which has three actions:
    </p><ul>
        <li>Left click: to gather the crowd at the cursor center</li>
        <li>Right click: to scatter the crowd to the cursor outsides</li>
        <li>Wheel: modify the cursor radius</li>
    </ul><p>
        The game has been created with Godot Engine, and its scripting language GDScript.
        In this project, I was in charge of programming the crowd.
        The people follow a modified Boids simulation:
        a bias is added for the cursor (which can gather or scatter the crowd),
        and there are two categories of people (blond-haired and brown-haired) which are not influencing each other.
        The arrival areas count the number of people inside, and trigger the end of the level
        if the number of people corresponds.

    <summary>Thomas Chronicles<span class="tags">[C++] [SFML]</span></summary>
    <p>
        During 2019 summer vacations, and to celebrate a friend's birthday, I have created the game <strong>Thomas Chronicles</strong>.
        It is a puzzle game greatly inspired by Professor Layton. Some puzzles have specific
        <em>gameplay</em>, like a sliding puzzle for instance, while others simply ask to enter the answer.
    </p><p>
        The game was created entirely in C++ with SFML, and was debugged on Windows and GNU/Linux.
        The objective was also to make a well-polished game, and I am pleased with the result.
        Especially, there are numerous transitions: fading, sliding, etc.
        Due to this, the code contains numerous state machines, if only the graphical part.

    <summary>Modi (QiOVA)<span class="tags">[C++] [Electronic]</span></summary>
    <p>
        During my internship at QiOVA, my job was to create an electronic circuit named Modi to test the QElec
        (a product which QiOVA sells), easily and automatically. 
        To do so, the circuit must measure the frequency of a digital signal, the voltage of an analog signal,
        the length of a pulse... and it must be controllable using a serial link with an Arduino.
        So I had to design the circuit, find and order the components, to program the Arduino Uno so it controls the
        various components and accepts commands from the serial link, and to test the proper functioning of Modi.

    <summary>Corentin le Magnanime<span class="tags">[C++] [SFML]</span></summary>
    <p>
        In 2018, to celebrate a friend's birthday too, with friends we decided to create a game bearing his effigy.
        The game contains two separate parts: the first being a mini-game sequence (like <em>Wario Ware</em>),
        the second being a <em>bullet hell</em> (dodging numerous projectiles, like <em>Touhou</em>).
    </p><p>
        We used C++ and SFML. I was charged with the main menu and the <em>bullet hell</em> part.
        <em>Bullet hell</em> is a game kind which I like, so it has been a great pleasure to create one by myself.
        Notably, enemies and projectiles movements being refined, work was done to mathematically
        parameterize the trajectories.
