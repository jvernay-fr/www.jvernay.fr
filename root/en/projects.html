    <summary>jvWhiteboard<span class="tags">[Javascript] [WebRTC] [Python]</span></summary>
    <p>
        In order to experiment with WebRTC (peer-to-peer technology for the Web), I have created
        an application for distance meetings named <strong>jvWhiteboard</strong>, accessible
        <a href="https://experiments.jvernay.fr/whiteboard/">on my website</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        A user can create a meeting room. An ID is given to them, which they can share to other
        users so that they can join this meeting room. Once the users have joined the room,
        they can broadcast their video and audio, chat with text, share files, and draw collaboratively.
        Excepting the creation and connection to rooms (which need a signaling server), every
        interaction between users are peer-to-peer with WebRTC (and so, they are crypted).
    </p>
    <p>
        To do this project, I have used the standard technologies HTML5/CSS3/Javascript, without
        any framework. I have used two external libraries (SVG.js and saveSvgAsPng.js) which allowed
        me to avoid direct manipulation of drawings. I have implemented the remainder of frontend
        (signaling with Websockets, videos, drawing synchronisation, chat, file sharing...)
        directly with the standard Web APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the backend, I use a server scripted with Python and using the websockets library, which
        keeps a connection with every user of a room and transmits negocations between users
        (which IP to use to join others, which codec to send video, etc).

    <summary>Figée dans le passé<span class="tags">[Game Jam] [Godot Engine]</span></summary>
    <p>
        I participated with a friend to the WonderJam UQAC 2021, a Game Jam organsied by University of
        Québec At Chicoutimi, and sponsored by Ubisoft Saguenay.
        The theme was <strong>Resistance</strong>, and we had three gameplay constraints:
        <em>Arcade, Versus, Physics-based</em>.
        We have created<strong>Figée dans le passé (Frozen in the past)</strong>, playable in the browser at <a href="https://julien-vernay.itch.io/figee-dans-le-passe">itch.io</a>.
        The objective is to run away the fastest possible, in a puzzle-platformer 2D based on physics.
        Besides jumping, two actions are available: hit boxes to project them, and freeze the boxes we
        have just projected.
    </p><p>
        The game has been created with Godot Engine, and its scripting language GDScript.
        We were two, and we each have took part in every aspect: player movements, physics, 2 player mode,
        level design... Musics and graphics were found elsewhere (see CREDITS.txt in the sources).

    <summary>System Simulation: Elevators<span class="tags">[Simulation] [Javascript]</span></summary>
    <p>
        During my system simulation course at UQAC, I had to create a simulation to answer the question
        <q>What would be the repercussion of adding a third elevator in a seven-floor building?</q>
        I have developed a simulation to observe these repercussions.
        More informations are available on <a href="/fr/simu-proj/">the simulation page</a>.

    <summary>Crowd Control<span class="tags">[Game Jam] [Godot Engine]</span></summary>
    <p>
        In July 2020, I took part with two friends at the GMTK Game Jam, whose theme was <strong>Out of Control</strong>.
        Our game entry is <strong>Crowd Control</strong>, playable in the browser at <a href="https://nitsugua.itch.io/crowd-control">itch.io</a>.
        In this game, you must control the crowd so that it goes to the designated area.
        To do so, you use your mouse, which has three actions:
    </p><ul>
        <li>Left click: to gather the crowd at the cursor center</li>
        <li>Right click: to scatter the crowd to the cursor outsides</li>
        <li>Wheel: modify the cursor radius</li>
    </ul><p>
        The game has been created with Godot Engine, and its scripting language GDScript.
        In this project, I was in charge of programming the crowd.
        The people follow a modified Boids simulation:
        a bias is added for the cursor (which can gather or scatter the crowd),
        and there are two categories of people (blond-haired and brown-haired) which are not influencing each other.
        The arrival areas count the number of people inside, and trigger the end of the level
        if the number of people corresponds.

    <summary>Ariane Simulator<span class="tags">[C++] [OpenCV] [Image Processing]</span></summary>
    <p>
        For a scholar project, with a colleague we created the game <strong>Ariane Simulator</strong>.
        This is a first-person maze game in which we move using our head's orientation.
        We detect several head positions which correspond to a movement in the game.
    </p>
    <figure>

    </figure>
    <p>
        The project was done in C++ using Qt, OpenGL and OpenCV.
        I was in charged with the image processing part. With OpenCV, I get the camera images.
        Then I search for the face and the nose. The detection is based on using pre-trained Haar cascades.
        However some modifications have been made to answer our application's needs.
        The Haar cascade for the nose was trained for front face, but we also need to detect
        the nose from the side, because the head's orientation will change.
        Since we use a video stream, I use the correlation with a previous found nose
        when the Haar cascade doesn't work.

    <summary>Thomas Chronicles<span class="tags">[C++] [SFML]</span></summary>
    <p>
        During 2019 summer vacations, and to celebrate a friend's birthday, I have created the game <strong>Thomas Chronicles</strong>.
        It is a puzzle game greatly inspired by Professor Layton. Some puzzles have specific
        <em>gameplay</em>, like a sliding puzzle for instance, while others simply ask to enter the answer.
    </p><p>
        The game was created entirely in C++ with SFML, and was debugged on Windows and GNU/Linux.
        The objective was also to make a well-polished game, and I am pleased with the result.
        Especially, there are numerous transitions: fading, sliding, etc.
        Due to this, the code contains numerous state machines, if only the graphical part.

    <summary>Modi (QiOVA)<span class="tags">[C++] [Electronic]</span></summary>
    <p>
        During my internship at QiOVA, my job was to create an electronic circuit named Modi to test the QElec
        (a product which QiOVA sells), easily and automatically. 
        To do so, the circuit must measure the frequency of a digital signal, the voltage of an analog signal,
        the length of a pulse... and it must be controllable using a serial link with an Arduino.
        So I had to design the circuit, find and order the components, to program the Arduino Uno so it controls the
        various components and accepts commands from the serial link, and to test the proper functioning of Modi.
    </p>

    <summary>Corentin le Magnanime<span class="tags">[C++] [SFML]</span></summary>
    <p>
        In 2018, to celebrate a friend's birthday too, with friends we decided to create a game bearing his effigy.
        The game contains two separate parts: the first being a mini-game sequence (like <em>Wario Ware</em>),
        the second being a <em>bullet hell</em> (dodging numerous projectiles, like <em>Touhou</em>).
    </p><p>
        We used C++ and SFML. I was charged with the main menu and the <em>bullet hell</em> part.
        <em>Bullet hell</em> is a game kind which I like, so it has been a great pleasure to create one by myself.
        Notably, enemies and projectiles movements being refined, work was done to mathematically
        parameterize the trajectories.
